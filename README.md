# Longest-Compound

# Description 

I used url request to fetch the long list of compiled words. 


# Method: Brute Force Algortithm

Using a brute force algorithm checks the combinations for each word that's compiled in the array

# Programming Language 

Python (object oriented programming)

# Testing 

I created a url with that contained only
       "cat
       cats
       catsdogcats
       catxdogcatsrat
       dog
       dogcatsdog
       hippopotamuses
       rat
       ratcatdogcat"
because the main(new) url takes an hour to completely run the script
